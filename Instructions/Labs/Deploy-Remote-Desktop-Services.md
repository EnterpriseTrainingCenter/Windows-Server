## Introduction

Your company wants to create a full Remote Desktop Services session deployment. For the first tests, you want to implement a simple deployment consisting of one connection broker server, three session host servers, one RD web server and one RD licensing server. Moreover, you want to test the load balancing and reconnection of users between session hosts.
