1. [Containerize a sample app](#exercise-2-containerize-a-sample-app)

## Exercise 1: Run the first container

1. [Configure nested virtualization](#task-1-configure-nested-virtualization) for the VM WIN-VN2-SRV2
1. [Download and install Docker CE](#task-2-download-and-install-docker-ce) on VN2-SRV2
1. [Pull the Nano server base image](#task-3-pull-the-nano-server-base-image)
1. [Run the Nano server image in a container](#task-4-run-the-nano-server-image-in-a-container) with the user ContainerAdministrator and create a simple text file in it
1. [Create a new container image](#task-5-create-a-new-container-image) from the container you created with the name helloworld and run a new container from the image, emitting the content of the text file you created

### Task 1: Configure nested virtualization

Perform this task on the host.

1. Open **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.
1. In Windows PowerShell (Admin), for **WIN-PM-SRV1**, shut down the virtual machine, expose the virtualtion extensions to the virtual machine, enable MAC address spoofing, disable dynamic memory and set the startup memory to **4 GB**, and start the virtual machine again.

    ````powershell
    $vMName = 'WIN-PM-SRV1'
    Stop-VM -VMName $vMName
    Set-VMProcessor -VMName $vMName -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true
    Get-VMNetworkAdapter -VMName $vMName |
    Set-VMNetworkAdapter -MacAddressSpoofing On
    Set-VM -VMName $vMName -StaticMemory -MemoryStartupBytes 4GB
    Start-VM -VMName $vMName
    ````

### Task 2: Download and install Docker CE

Perform this task on PM-SRV1.

1. Sign in as **Administrator**.
1. In SConfig, enter **15**.
1. Download and install Docker CE from Github.

    ````powershell
    Set-Location c:\LabResources
    Invoke-WebRequest `
        -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Windows-Containers/Main/helpful_tools/Install-DockerCE/install-docker-ce.ps1' `
        -OutFile install-docker-ce.ps1 `
        -UseBasicParsing
    .\install-docker-ce.ps1 -HyperV
    ````

    Wait for the instalation to finish. This will take less than a minute. The computer will during the installation.

1. After the computer finished starting, sign in as **Administrator**.

    The PowerShell script should start automatically. After a few seconds, the script should complete.

1. Close the windows with the script.

### Task 3: Pull the Nano server base image

Perform this task on CL1.

1. Open **Terminal**.
1. In Terminal, enter a remote PowerShell session to PM-SRV1.

    ````powershell
    Enter-PSSession PM-SRV1
    `````

1. Download and install the base image for Nano server.

    ````powershell
    docker image pull mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:ltsc2022
    ````

1. Query your local docker image repository.

    ````powershell
    docker image ls
    `````

    You should see the image of microsoft/nanoserver.

1. Exit the remote PowerShell session

    ````powershell
    Exit-PSSession
    ````

### Task 4: Run the Nano server image in a container

Perform this task on PM-SRV1.

1. In SConfig, enter **15**.
1. Start a container with an interactive session from the nanoserver image.

    ````powershell
    docker container run --interactive --tty --user ContainerAdministrator mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:ltsc2022 cmd.exe
    ````

    This command starts a new container using the Nano server image. The -i or --interactive option tells Docker to keep STDIN open even if not attached. The -t or --tty option tells Docker to allocate a pseudo-TTY. Within the container, cmd.exe is executed.

    Now, your are in a cmd.exe session within the container.

1. In the container, create a simple text file **Hello.txt** in **C:\\Users\\ContainerUser** and exit from the container.

    ````shell
    echo "Hello World!" > Hello.txt
    exit
    `````

### Task 5: Create a new container image

Perform this task on PM-SRV1.

1. In SConfig, enter **15**.
1. Get the container ID for the container you just existed.

    ````powershell
    docker container ls --all
    ````

    Take a note of the CONTAINER ID of your container.

1. Create a new **heloworld** image that includes the changes in the first container you ran. Replace the first parameter with the container ID noted in the previous step.

    ````powershell
    docker container commit bb91a76b8023 helloworld
    ````

1. List the image in your local repository.

    ````powershell
    docker image ls
    ````

    You should see the helloworld image in addition to the Nano server image.

1. Run the new container, type the content of **C:\\Users\\ContainerUser\\Hello.txt** and remove the container.

    ````powershell
    docker container run --rm helloworld cmd.exe /s /c type Hello.txt
    ````

    You should see the content of Hello.txt.

## Exercise 2: Containerize a sample app

1. [Install Git](#task-1-install-git) on VN2-SRV2
1. [Install Visual Studio Code](#task-2-install-visual-studio-code) on VN2-SRV2 and add the Docker extension
1. [Clone the app repository](#task-3-clone-the-app-repository) <https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Virtualization-Documentation.git>
1. [Build and run the app](#task-4-build-and-run-the-app): To build the app, you must change the base image for the build environment to mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0.406-nanoserver-ltsc2022. Run the container in Hyper-V isolation mode and map port 80 of the container to port 5000 on the host.

### Task 1: Install Git

Perform this task on CL1.

1. Run **Terminal**.
1. In Terminal, install **Git** using winget.

    ````powershell
    winget install Git.Git --accept-source-agreements
    ````

    Wait for the installation to complete. This takes less than a minute.

### Task 2: Install Visual Studio Code

Perform this task on CL1.

1. Open **Terminal**.
1. In Terminal, install **Visual Studio Code** using winget.

    ````powershell
    winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode --accept-source-agreements
    ````

    Wait for the installation to complete. This takes less than a minute.

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
1. In Visual Studio Code, close the tab **Walkthrough: Setup VS Code**.
1. On the left-hand side click the icon *Extensions*.
1. In EXTENSIONS, in **Search Extensions in Marketplace**, type **Docker** and click Docker.

    Make sure, the extension looks similar to [figure 1].

1. In the extension screen of Docker, click **Install**.

### Task 3: Clone the app repository

Perform this task on CL1.

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
1. In Visual Studio Code, on the menu, click **View**, **Command Palette...** or press CTRL + SHIFT + P.
1. In the command palette, search for and click **Git: Clone**.
1. In Provide repository URL or pick a repository source, enter **https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Virtualization-Documentation.git**.
1. In Choose a folder to clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Virtualization-Documentation.git into, navigate to **C:\\LabResources** and click **Select as Repository Destination**.

    Wait for the cloning to finish. This takes a few seconds.

1. In Would you like to open the cloned repository, click **Open**.
1. In Do you trust the authors of the files in the folder, click **Yes, I trust the authors**

### Task 4: Build and run the app

Peform this task on CL1.

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
1. In Visual Studio Code, if the repository **VIRTUALIZATION-DOCUMENTATION** is not open:

    1. On the menu, click **File**, **Open Folder...**
    1. In Open Folder, navigate to **C:\\LabResources\Virtualization-Documentation** and click **Select Folder**.
    1. In Do you trust the authors of the files in the folder, click **Yes, I trust the authors**

1. In Explorer view, click **windows-container-samples**, **asp-net-getting-started** and **dockerfile**.
1. Change the first line to base the container on the following image.

    ````text
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0.406-nanoserver-ltsc2022 AS build-env
    ````

    Take a look at the file content. You can find a line-by-line explanation under <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/building-sample-app#write-the-dockerfile>

    *Note*:  For building containers, hyper-v isolation is not available. The source image has to be changed, because the original image does not run on Windows Server 2025 in process isolation mode. Therefore, we need an image of a more recent operating system that runs in process isolation mode on Windows Server 2025. Alternatively, you could build the container on an older version of Windows Server.

1. On the menu click **File**, **Save**.
1. On the menu, click **View**, **Terminal**.
1. In the TERMINAL pane, create a new remote PowerShell session to PM-SRV1 and store it in a variable.

    ````powershell
    $pSSession = New-PSSession PM-SRV1
    ````

1. Copy the source files of the sample application to PM-SRV1.

    ````powershell
    Copy-Item `
        -Path `
            C:\LabResources\Virtualization-Documentation\windows-container-samples\asp-net-getting-started\ `
        -ToSession $psSession `
        -Destination c:\LabResources\ `
        -Container `
        -Recurse
    ````

1. Enter the session to PM-SRV1.

    ````powershell
    Enter-PSSession $psSession
    `````

1. Navigate to the directory of the sample application with the dockerfile.

    ````powershell
    Set-Location C:\LabResources\asp-net-getting-started\
    `````

1. Build the container from the dockerfile.

    ````powershell
    docker buildx build -t my-asp-app .
    ````

    If the command fails with an unknow switch error, try the alias command instead:

    ````powershell
    docker build -t my-asp-app .
    ````

    Wait for the build to complete. This takes a few minutes or two.

1. Run the container detached in hyper-v isolation mode, map port **5000** on the host to port **80** in the container and give the container the convenient name **myapp**.

    ````powershell
    docker container run -d -p 5000:80 --isolation hyperv --name myapp my-asp-app
    ````

    *Note:* The container must be run in Hyper-V isolation mode, because it is based on an older version of Windows Server.

1. Open **Microsoft Edge**.
1. In Microsoft Edge, navigate to <http://pm-srv1:5000>.

    You should see a sample web site.
