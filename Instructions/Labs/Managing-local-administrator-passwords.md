## Introduction

Your helpdesk users all use a well-known password for the local Administrator. Because people in your helpdesk come, and you want to audit the use of the Administrator accounts, you want to implement the local Administrator password solution and validate it.

## Exercises

1. [Implement Local Administrator Password Solution](#exercise-1-implement-local-administrator-password-solution)
1. [Use Local Administrator Password Solution](#exercise-2-use-local-administrator-password-solution)

## Exercise 1: Implement Local Administrator Password Solution

1. [Prepare Active Directory for LAPS](#task-1-prepare-active-directory-for-laps)
1. [Configure the policy for LAPS](#task-2-configure-the-policy-for-laps) and apply it to the domain. The Policy should configure the following settings:

    * Backup passwords to Active Directory
    * Enable the default administrator account and randomize its name
    * Configure password complexity to use large Letters, small letters, number, and specials with improved readability
    * Configure the password lenth with 14 characters
    * Configure the password age for 30 days
    * Do not allow password expiration time longer than required by policy
    * Enable password encyption
    * Enable password encryption
    * Configure the post-authentication actions to reset the password, logoff the managed account, and terminate any remaining processes after 8 hours

### Task 1: Prepare Active Directory for LAPS

Perform this task on CL1.

1. Open **Terminal**.
1. In Terminal, extend the Active Directory schema.

    ````powershell
    Update-LapsADSchema
    ````

1. At the prompt The 'ms-LAPS-Password' schema attribute needs to be added to the AD schema, enter **a**.
1. Grant the managed device password update permission.

    ````powershell
    $identity = 'ou=Devices, dc=ad, dc=adatum, dc=com'
    Set-LapsADComputerSelfPermission -Identity $identity
    ````

1. Query Extend Rights permission.

    ````powershell
    Find-LapsADExtendedRights -Identity $identity
    ````

    The property ExtendRightHolders should contain NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and AD\Domain Admins only.

### Task 2: Configure the policy for LAPS

Perform this task on CL1.

1. Open **Group Policy Management**.
1. In Group Policy Management, expand **Forest: ad.adatum.com**, **Domains**, **ad.adatum.com**, and click **Group Policy Objects**.
1. In the context-menu of **Group Policy Objects**, click **New**.
1. In New GPO, under **Name**, type **Custom Computer LAPS**.
1. In the context-menu of **Custom Computer LAPS**, click **Edit**.
1. In Group Policy Management Editor, expand **Computer Configuration**, **Policies**, **Administrative Templates**, **System** and click **LAPS**.
1. Under LAPS, double-click **Configure password backup directory**.
1. In Configure password backup directory, click **Enabled**. Beside **Backup directory**, click **Active Directory**. Click **OK**.
1. In **Group Policy Management Editor**, under **LAPS**, double-click **Configure automatic account management**.
1. In Configure automatic account management, click **Enabled**. Under **Specify the target account to manage**, click **Manage the build-in admin account**. Click to enable **Enable the managed account** and **Randomize the name of the managed account**. Click **OK**.
1. In **Group Policy Management Editor**, under **LAPS**, double-click **Password Settings**.
1. In Password Settings, click **Enabled**. Under **Password Complexity**, click **Large Letters + small letters + number + specials (improved readability)**. Beside **Password Length**, ensure **14** is filled in. Beside **Password Age (Days)**, ensure **30** is filled in. Click **OK**.
1. In **Group Policy Management Editor**, under **LAPS**, double-click **Do not allow password expiration time longer than required by policy**.
1. In Do not allow password expiration time longer than required by policy, click **Enabled** and click **OK**.
1. In **Group Policy Management Editor**, under **LAPS**, double-click **Enable password encryption**.
1. In Enable password encryption, click **Enabled** and click **OK**.

    By default, only Domain Admins can decrypt passwords. If you want to allow another group or user to decrypt passwords, you should configure the **Configure authorized password decryptors** setting. For this lab, leave it to the default.

1. In **Group Policy Management Editor**, under **LAPS**, double-click **Enable password backup for DSRM accounts**.
1. In Enable password backup for DSRM accounts, click **Enabled** and click **OK**.
